I'm sharing a Next.js project split across multiple files. Each file contains a compressed chunk. Here's how to process them:

1. Combine all chunks in order (part001, part002, etc.)
2. Extract the 'content' field from each chunk's JSON
3. Concatenate all content strings
4. Base64 decode → zlib decompress → JSON parse
5. You'll get a complete file structure with:
   - Paths
   - File contents (base64 encoded)
   - Validation hashes
